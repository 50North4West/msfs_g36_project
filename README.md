# MSFS G36 Project version 0.3

This is the improvement project for the MSFS default G36. At this moment, the modificatiom mainly focuses on flight performance fixes. This was made possible with the help of the community consisting of both enthousiasts and G/A36 (ex-)pilots.

Current features of this modification are:

* Adjusted climb and cruise performance to match the Bonanza A36 POH charts. 
* Redone flap and gear drag
* Continental IO550-B is now a six-cylinder
* Adjusted idle RPM to ~600. This prevents the unexpected shutdown of a warm engine when idle
* Fixed erroneous engine efficiency increase around 2000 rpm
* Fixed autopilot altitude holding the wrong altitude at non-standard atmospheric pressures
* Removed Pitot Heat caution
* Added low fuel cautions and warnings
* Added BUSES TIED advisory (note the electrical system is not actually modelled int this way, it is just the advisory text)
